## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### I got to understand the difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox thoroughly


CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox are both layout systems in CSS, but they have different use cases and are suited for different kinds of layouts.

CSS Grid is particularly useful for creating grid-like layouts with rows and columns, while Flexbox is better suited for creating flexible layouts where items can be arranged horizontally or vertically.

In the CSS code  provided, I used Flexbox to center the main content of the web page vertically and horizontally, and to align the navigation menu items horizontally in the header.


### Continued development

I tried to use the REACT Library to complete the assignment but got it messed up after several attempts. I really need to understand React beyond npx create-react-app  even after following thr tic-tac-toe
exercise at the REACT site more than once.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf5K0XgXrRs) - the use of codepen.io was reinforced through watching this video. The tutor also made it easier for me to understand semantic HTML.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sass/projects/refactor-scss-1) - This lesson helped me finally to understand how to refactor CSS to SCSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
