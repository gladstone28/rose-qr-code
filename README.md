## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### I got to understand the difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox thoroughly


CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox are both layout systems in CSS, but they have different use cases and are suited for different kinds of layouts.

CSS Grid is particularly useful for creating grid-like layouts with rows and columns, while Flexbox is better suited for creating flexible layouts where items can be arranged horizontally or vertically.

In the CSS code  provided, I used Flexbox to center the main content of the web page vertically and horizontally, and to align the navigation menu items horizontally in the header.


### Continued development

I tried to use the REACT Library to complete the assignment but got it messed up after several attempts. I need to really understand React beyong npx create-react-app

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf5K0XgXrRs) - the use of codepen.io was rein-forced through this video. The tutor also made it easier for me to understand semantic HTML.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sass/projects/refactor-scss-1) - This lesson helped me finally to understand how to refactor CSS to SCSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
